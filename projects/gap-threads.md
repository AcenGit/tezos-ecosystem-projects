Built on a more energy-efficient blockchain, Tezos, Gapâ€™s first NFT collaboration is designed with Brandon Sines, the artist behind Frank Ape. Gap's first collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is set to bring its brand and iconic product to new and existing customers in a rapidly evolving digital ecosystem. For this launch, Gap is introducing a gamified digital experience celebrating creatives and giving customers the unique opportunity to own a limited edition, collectible Gap hoodie.
