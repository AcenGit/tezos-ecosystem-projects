Domains can be used to associate an address, share an avatar, publish contact information and more. Wallets and other projects in the ecosystem will let you use domain names directly instead of addresses and show domain names where Tezos addresses would be normally. The long term plan for Tezos Domains includes allowing websites to be built on Tezos Domains using decentralized content hosting like IPFS. This could serve as an alternative to traditional centralized solutions.

The information you can currently associate with your domain include:

Your Tezos address
Avatar
Nickname
E-mail
Website
Physical Address
Once you register your domain, you will be able to change this data in the domain details screen.

Subdomains
By registering a domain you get control of your own personal namespace. You can create any number of subdomains and use it for different purposes.
