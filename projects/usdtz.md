USDtez (Symbol: USDtz / USDTZ) is a USD-pegged stablecoin based on a fungible Tezos community standard â€” the FA token standard. USDtez is pegged to a formally-verifiable measure of (1:1 parity) value between itself and the United States Dollar (USD) providing a solvent, and scalable source of liquidity that is the ideal solution for low-fee Tezos-based asset trading.
