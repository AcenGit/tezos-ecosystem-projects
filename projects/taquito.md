Hit the ground running using: Taquito's Smart-Contract abstractions makes working with contracts feel like your working with plain old JavaScript objects. Perfect for any JavaScript project on the front-end, back-end or command line with minimal dependencies, Taquito has no reliance on any stack by default, except the Tezos Node. Taquito comes complete with a well-documented API using TypeDoc, continuous integration tests against the Tezos Node; versioned releases published to npmjs.org.
