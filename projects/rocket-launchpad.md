Rocket is a decentralized IDO launchpad on Tezos that utilizes a tier based system that allows users the ability to participate in presales of new and exciting Tezos based projects at the ground floor. All projects are vetted through Rocket's submission process to ensure the best projects are launching with the best intentions, and funds are handled via smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.
